Life has been seriously difficult lately. My body apparently thinks LIVING is incredibly difficult and existing physically hurts. I never wrote the update email, anxiety, chaos, being used to point of developing rather bad stomach ulcers, again, has a way of doing that. My Spring Break is actually going to be a Spring Catchup week instead.. sigh.. then once caught up, hopefully I can stay that way!

Oh, I am only missing a few things from my last week's website update, which is going to be finished tomorrow and then the Javascript started directly after, sigh.. but for now, I need to go drink some more chalk-tasting-crap (Sulcralfate) and lay down because I can't keep my eyes open--getting labs again to check iron levels and see if they are hemorrhaging again.. -.-
