Another rough week.. Astrid (oldest's cat) passed away Friday night. Was also informed my oldest tore his MPFL ligament and fractured his femur when his kneecap slammed into it during dislocation. Nothing is severe enough for a surgical repair, but the prevention surgery (patella stabilization) is still highly recommended. 

On a good note, I just paid for an F2 Savannah cat who will be here Wednesday morning. She's coming in from Florida. Hopefully she can help brighten the place up for a bit, heh. Including photos of her in the folder! Well, her, her brother, her F1 mother and her F4 father!
