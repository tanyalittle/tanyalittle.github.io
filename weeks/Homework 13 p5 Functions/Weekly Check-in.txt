18 April 2023 Check In

Things just never seem to get any better. I ended last week's check-in note saying that we had bought a new kitten for our son.. it was a complete scam. I should have known. I mean, I DID know.. I even told the scammers I thought I was being scammed. But desperation, screaming neighbor baby, depression and heartbreak.. wanting so desperately to help heal my childrens' wounds.. sigh.. I stupidly thought Cash App was not so sketchy.. working with the bank to recoup some of the funds..

A few days after Astrid (son's emotional support Bengal cat) passed, our kids started getting sick, again. Fevers and puking for days. Then, of course, the mum gets it last. I've been sick for days and can barely sleep. Ugh! 

Then another tire popped today.. the first one was a couple weeks ago. It's always, always, always something.. sigh..

Our internet also won't work for crap most of the time. We have had Spectrum come out 3 separate times now and it never helps. It just won't stay connected. So uploading sucks and the Kahoot Quiz was not a possibility for this week. I've been connected to my phone's hotspot lately, ugh!


On the up side, I found this amazing little thing called timeboxing! I tried a bunch of different apps, many free, some not, until I stumbled upon Sunsama! At least time management and prioritizing is going a little bit easier.
