        <center><h3>My Photography Journey</h3></center>
        <p>I have always <b>loved</b> photography and seeing the world through a lens. As a child, my subjects were my Great Danes, and disposable cameras, my medium. After a while, my mom stopped paying to drop the cameras off for development, only to find a roll full of blurry animal shots.</p> 
        <p>Fast forward to motherhood, I received my first digital camera with the birth of my first son, in 2007. I became even more addicted and took pictures whenever I could. Over the next three years, I purchased a couple different digital cameras, upgrading specs each time.</p>
        <p>In June 2010, I took the plunge and invested in my first DSLR camera, a Canon Rebel T2i, and my first 365 daily photo project. A few months later, in September 2010, I was invited to contribute stock photography to Getty Images and have since joined multiple other stock companies. After years of pushing by family and friends, I finally did my first paid family sessions in the summer of 2014. I was also able to upgrade to a Canon 5d Mark III in 2017.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, depression and medical problems have caused my camera to dust over the past 4 years, with new photos coming few and far between.</p>
        <p>The following collection is a small sample of photos taken prior to my hiatus. They are not particularly special, but rather what readily on hand at the moment of this page's creation.</p>
