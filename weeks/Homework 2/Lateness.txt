I'm sorry, this past week has been absolute hell. It is currently 2:30am and I must be in up in a few hours to nanny my neighbor's 8 month old, don't ask, ugh. 

I know that late assignments are not accepted and that I was supposed to have prior authorization for an extension, but I was really hoping I would have completed everything by now and that nothing would have been late in the first place. I genuinely did not think it would take me this long to complete everything (I started at 6pm becase the last couple days have been full day homework/nanny/sick kids/torn tendons/nannying/now dead car/blah blah blah). 

Unfortunately, a significant part of my autism/ADHD/executive function deficit stuff is a time management issue--I actually got really excited when I saw that Randy Pausch had a lecture on that subject and can't wait to watch it! But I digress! 

Another issue is that I am perpetually and exhaustingly "too much." That was my number one "thing to work on" that I just told my newest VA therapist. I want to be.. less. Therefore, what SHOULD be a quick and "SHORT" essay or discussion post turns into a whole novel of oversharing and rambling nonsense. Sigh.. I didn't realize how much writing this class had. It's not a problem or even a bad thing! I absolutely LOVE to write! Too much. Which IS a problem.. Whatever, I'll stop now. 

Point is, I am still going to be doing the rest of Week 2 in the morning, for credit or otherwise, and then push everything through GitHub, which is why I made sure to make the folder and post the link to the homework assignment spot before midnight. That is all. Sorry. I don't know how to fix myself and when it is this late and inhibitions are lacking, it just gets that much worse. Ok, walking away now, or crawling, to bed.
